    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Save the Oceans Now is a global initiative dedicated to protecting and preserving the health of our oceans. 
      Founded in 2025, our mission is to raise awareness about marine conservation, reduce ocean pollution, 
      and promote sustainable practices that ensure a healthy planet for future generations.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is simple: to inspire, educate, and mobilize people around the world to take action for ocean protection.
      We work with communities, schools, governments, and NGOs to drive real change through awareness, policy, and on-the-ground projects.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <p>
      Our team includes marine biologists, environmental activists, educators, and volunteers from around the world. 
      We believe that protecting the ocean starts with people â€” and we are committed to being part of the solution.
