    <h2>Major Ocean Threats</h2>
    <p>
      Our oceans face a wide range of serious threats that endanger marine life, disrupt ecosystems, and impact human communities.
      Below are some of the most pressing challenges:
    </p>

    <h3>🌊 Plastic Pollution</h3>
    <p>
      Millions of tons of plastic waste end up in the ocean every year, harming marine animals who ingest or get entangled in it.
      Microplastics are now found in nearly every part of the marine food chain — even in the seafood we eat.
    </p>

    <h3>🔥 Climate Change</h3>
    <p>
      Rising ocean temperatures and acidification are bleaching coral reefs and shifting marine ecosystems.
      Melting polar ice and rising sea levels are also threatening coastal communities around the world.
    </p>

    <h3>🐟 Overfishing</h3>
    <p>
      Many fish populations are being depleted faster than they can reproduce. Unsustainable fishing practices are pushing some species to the brink of extinction and destroying ocean food webs.
    </p>

    <h3>☠️ Oil Spills & Chemical Waste</h3>
    <p>
      Toxic spills from ships and industrial runoff can poison marine environments for decades. These disasters have long-term effects on marine life and coastal economies.
    </p>

    <h3>🏗️ Habitat Destruction</h3>
    <p>
      Coastal development, seabed mining, and destructive fishing methods like trawling are destroying critical habitats such as mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs.
